# Marketing Analysis — Project

This project uses a dataset from Kaggle.

## Introduction

At my workplace, I’ve done extensive customer segmentation to better understand and satisfy our customers. Businesses thrive on customer satisfaction, retention, and loyalty, making it essential to know our customers deeply. Customer segmentation, particularly using machine learning, allows us to group customers based on common characteristics for tailored marketing strategies.

In this article, I’ll share my experience in segmenting customers using a machine-learning-based model.

## Dataset Overview

**Source:** Kaggle

**Description:** This dataset includes demographic and behavioral information about customers, useful for identifying distinct segments within the customer base.

### Key Features:

- **id:** Unique identifier for each customer.
- **age:** Age of the customer.
- **gender:** Gender of the customer (Male, Female, Other).
- **income:** Annual income of the customer (in USD).
- **spending_score:** Spending score (1–100), indicating the customer’s spending behavior and loyalty.
- **membership_years:** Number of years the customer has been a member.
- **purchase_frequency:** Number of purchases made by the customer in the last year.
- **preferred_category:** Preferred shopping category (Electronics, Clothing, Groceries, Home & Garden, Sports).
- **last_purchase_amount:** Amount spent by the customer on their last purchase (in USD).

Understanding the dataset is crucial as it forms the foundation of our segmentation model.

### Potential Uses:

- **Customer Segmentation:** Identify different customer segments based on their demographic and behavioral characteristics.
- **Targeted Marketing:** Develop targeted marketing strategies for different customer segments.
- **Customer Loyalty Programs:** Design loyalty programs based on customer spending behavior and preferences.

## Data Collection and Exploration

The dataset for this project is readily available on Kaggle. We begin by downloading it and importing it into the Jupyter Notebook where we’ll build our segmentation model.

### Step 1: Import Libraries and Load Data

First, import the necessary libraries and load the dataset. This dataset is in CSV format, so we’ll load it directly into our notebook.

### Step 2: Data Exploration

Exploring the data helps us understand its structure and content. Here’s how we proceed:

- **Understand the Data Structure:** Use the `shape()` function.
- **Summary Statistics:** Use the `describe()` function to understand central tendency, dispersion, and distribution shape.
- **Missing Values:** Check for completeness.
- **Data Distribution:** Visualize key features to understand their distributions.

### Step 3: Data Preprocessing

Preprocessing is essential for accurate analysis and modeling. It includes:

- **Handling Missing Values:** We have no missing values in our dataset.
- **Removing Duplicates:** Ensure no duplicate entries.
- **Scaling Numerical Data:** Improves model performance, especially for algorithms sensitive to feature scales.
- **Encoding Categorical Data:**
  - **One-Hot Encoding:** Converts categorical variables into binary vectors.
  - **Label Encoding:** Converts categorical labels into numeric values.

### Step 4: Model Building and Customer Segmentation

Using K-means clustering, we segment customers. Steps include:

- **Determine Optimal Number of Clusters:** Use the Elbow Method.
- **Apply K-means Clustering:** Initialize and fit the model with the optimal number of clusters.

### Step 5: Evaluation and Interpretation

After building the model, evaluate and interpret the clusters to understand the characteristics of each segment and derive actionable insights.

#### Segment 1:

- **Average Age:** 32
- **Average Income:** $95,749
- **Gender:** Male
- **Spending Score:** 42
- **Purchase Frequency:** 36
- **Preferred Category:** Electronics

**Recommendations:** Focus on electronics promotions tailored to this segment, highlight new products, and implement loyalty programs.

#### Segment 2:

- **Average Age:** 52
- **Average Income:** $75,836
- **Gender:** Other
- **Spending Score:** 52
- **Purchase Frequency:** 28
- **Preferred Category:** Groceries

**Recommendations:** Diversify grocery offerings, increase engagement with personalized recommendations, and initiate community programs.

#### Segment 3:

- **Average Age:** 46
- **Average Income:** $96,057
- **Gender:** Female
- **Spending Score:** 56
- **Purchase Frequency:** 14
- **Preferred Category:** Sports

**Recommendations:** Emphasize sports and fitness products, promote health and wellness events, and introduce subscription services.

## Conclusion

Customer segmentation is a powerful tool that helps businesses understand and serve their customers better. By leveraging machine learning, we can uncover insights that would be difficult to obtain through traditional methods. This project demonstrates the importance of data-driven decision-making in crafting targeted marketing strategies and enhancing customer satisfaction.

As we continue to collect and analyze customer data, our segmentation models will evolve, providing even deeper insights. Remember, the goal is not just to segment customers but to use these segments to deliver personalized experiences that meet their unique needs and preferences.

I hope this project inspires you to explore customer segmentation in your work and harness the power of data to drive business success.

Thank you for following along, and I look forward to sharing more insights and projects in the future.
